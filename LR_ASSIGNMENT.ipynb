        "  -> 1. Linearity\n",
        "\n",
        "The relationship between the independent variable and the dependent variable should be straight-line in nature.\n",

        "This means when one variable increases or decreases, the other should change in a consistent direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "You can check this by making a scatter plot — the points should form roughly a straight line.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Independence of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "The prediction errors (the differences between actual and predicted values) should be independent of each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "In simple terms, one observation’s error should not affect another’s.\n",
        "\n",
        "This is especially important for time-based data to ensure no pattern or trend exists in the errors.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Constant Variance of Errors (Homoscedasticity)\n",
        "\n",
        "The errors should have equal spread across all levels of the independent variable.\n",

        "The amount of variation in the errors should not increase or decrease as the predicted values get larger or smaller.\n",

        "\n",
        "4. Normality of Errors\n",
        "\n",
        "The errors should be normally distributed — meaning most errors are small, and large errors are rare.\n",
        "\n",
        "This helps ensure that hypothesis tests and confidence intervals are valid.\n",
        "\n",

        "5. No Outliers or Influential Points\n",

        "Outliers can pull the regression line away from the true pattern.\n",

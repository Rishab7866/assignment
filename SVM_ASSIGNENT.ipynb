        "  -> Information Gain is a metric derived from information theory used to quantify how much “information” (i.e., reduction in uncertainty) is obtained by splitting a dataset by a particular attribute (feature).\n",
        "\n",
        "  How is Information Gain used in Decision Trees?\n",
        "\n",
        "In the context of decision tree learning (e.g., algorithms like ID3, C4.5), Information Gain is used as a splitting criterion to choose which attribute to split on at each node. Here is how:\n",
        "\n",
        "At a given node in the tree, you have a subset of training examples.\n",
        "\n",
        "For each candidate attribute (that hasn’t been used yet in the path), compute the IG of splitting on that attribute.\n",
        "\n",
        "Choose the attribute with the highest Information Gain — i.e., the one that gives the largest reduction in entropy (most “pure” or homogeneous split) for that node.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "Create child nodes corresponding to the values of that attribute, and repeat recursively on each child subset until stopping criteria (e.g., all examples in subset belong to one class, or no attributes remain)\n",
        "\n",
        "Because each split ideally reduces uncertainty (increases class homogeneity), the tree becomes more confident in its predictions as you go down."

In other words, while building the tree you check whether further splitting is justified; if not, you stop and make the current node a leaf."
